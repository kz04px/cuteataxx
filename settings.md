# Engines
Where to find and what to call engines, as well as what settings they need.

### __engines:name__
The name the engine will play under.

### __engines:path__
Global path to the engine.

### __engines:protocol__
- UAI -- the only protocol engines should use based on UCI from chess.
- FSF -- supported exclusively for the sake of Fairy-Stockfish found [here](https://github.com/ianfab/Fairy-Stockfish).
- KataGo -- partial support exclusively for a KataGo fork found [here](https://github.com/hzyhhzy/KataGo/tree/Ataxx).

### __engines:arguments__
Command line arguments to be passed to the engine.

### __engines:timecontrol__
An engine specific override for the global time control setting. Allows time odds to be used.

### __engines:builtin__
This command lets you choose from a limited selection of built in engines. They are mostly intended as opponents for weak engines to test correctness. When using this option, only specify the built in player and the name it will use.
- random -- play a random legal move.
- mostcaptures -- play the move that maximises `num_captures + is_single`.
- leastcaptures -- play the move that minimises `num_captures + is_single`.

Example:
```
    "name": "RandomPlayer",
    "builtin": "random"
```
